# HHM

An implementation of a Helmholtz Machine Using Pybrain.

The files with "demo" in the titles train the helmholtz machine with different environments. Each environment consist of a distribution of bit vectors representing different visual patterns. 

The experiment file creates an agent that is merely a series of helmholtz machines and tests it, training it on different environments and checking to see if it is able to differentiate between them.
